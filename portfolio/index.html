      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I have a passion for learning and growth. When I'm not studying or
        working, you can find me reading self-help books, listening to podcasts,
        discussing current affairs, or exploring the world of tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am proudly South African, growing up, I was surrounded by vibrant
        traditions and values that have shaped my identity. I'm fluent in Zulu
        and have a deep appreciation for African cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following a brief stint in college pursuing Financial Management, I
        discovered a passion for technology through a module on Computerised
        Financial Systems. This newfound interest led me to explore opportunites
        in the tech industry, including an introduction to AI through my work at
        an events company. The ALX program played a pivotal role in shaping my
        understanding of tech industry, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to
        pivot into a field that aligns with my interest and skills, regardless
        of my educational background
